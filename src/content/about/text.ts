export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I really enjoy doing web development and working on quality products. I was first introduced to HTML code 3 years ago and since then I have continued to improve my skills in design, frontend and backend development. In addition to freelancing, I interned at an IT company and worked at a startup. Feel free to email me about your IT (or non-IT) experience, I'd be interested in chatting with you`
